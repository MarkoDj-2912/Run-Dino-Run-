# ðŸ¦– Dino Desert Run

Endless Runner game made for **Two Desperados Game Jam 2025**.  
**Theme:** *Three Rules*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Theme: "Three Rules"
The game is built around three core rules:

1. **Don't touch the cactuses** â€“ Touching any cactus immediately resets the game.
2. **Collect coins** â€“ Collect coins to increase your score and survive checkpoints.
3. **Pass through the checkpoint with enough coins** â€“ If you don't have the required amount of coins when crossing a checkpoint, the game resets.

Extra twist:
- **Meat pickups** appear occasionally â€“ skipping them will reset the game.

## ðŸ•¹ Gameplay
You play as a dinosaur running endlessly through a desert landscape.  
Your goal is to survive as long as possible by:
- Jumping over cactuses and other obstacles.
- Collecting coins scattered across the path.
- Passing checkpoints with enough coins to continue.
- Making sure you don't miss meat pickups.

The game speeds up over time, making it harder to react.
